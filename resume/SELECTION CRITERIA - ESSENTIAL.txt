SELECTION CRITERIA - ESSENTIAL

1. A relevant degree with subsequent relevant experience, or equivalent extensive experience and specialist knowledge in developing and delivery of digital/web projects.


2. Demonstrable understanding of web development best practice including those relating to responsive design, accessibility and user experience.

In the positions I understand the big picture. Some developers love to code so much that they skip the first step — planning — and end up writing code over and over again. First ask, what’s the overall intention, or bigger picture of the project? This leads to understanding priorities and not getting bogged in the insignificant details that may steer you off course.
Start with the user experience. Paper or a mock-up are cheap to change compared to the cost of scrapping a project your users don’t want to use. A good rule of thumb to remember is that 70 percent of development efforts should be spent on research and design, and then the final 30 percent on programming. By understanding the potential user, and creating a user-friendly design, the development phase will significantly less complex!

4. WCAG2.0 standard.
It is important to let every kind of user to access our web, 
All non-text content presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose.
Technique: This is viewed by many as the most important success criterion as it allows people who are blind or vision impaired to understand the visual aspects of a Web page.  If something is represented visually, such as an image, it should have a brief text description embedded in the code.  This description should reflect the purpose of the image and the context in which it is being used.
