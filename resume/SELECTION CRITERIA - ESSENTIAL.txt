SELECTION CRITERIA - ESSENTIAL

1. A relevant degree with subsequent relevant experience, or equivalent extensive experience and specialist knowledge in developing and delivery of digital/web projects.

I graduated from a renowned university majored in Network Engineering, in there I got solid IT knowledge and programming skills. In addition, by the following years, I worked in IT companies, played roles like software engineer, got loads of project experience at the same time.


2. Demonstrable understanding of web development best practice including those relating to responsive design, accessibility and user experience.

In the positions I always try to understand the big picture with a start of a good planning, try to figure out overall intention. This leads to understanding priorities and not getting wrong in the insignificant details. Start with the user experience, paper or a mock-up are cheap to change compared to the cost of scrapping a project. By understanding the potential user, and creating a user-friendly design, the development phase will significantly less complex.

3.wordpress experience

Once before, I worked on a project call SAMeBaby, targeting to teach none-English speaking children learning English. It is a good demonstration of the combined usage of not only WordPress, but Moodle.

4. WCAG2.0 standard.
It is important to let every kind of user to access our web, 
All non-text content presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose.
Technique: This is viewed by many as the most important success criterion as it allows people who are blind or vision impaired to understand the visual aspects of a Web page.  If something is represented visually, such as an image, it should have a brief text description embedded in the code.  This description should reflect the purpose of the image and the context in which it is being used.
